# Calibration Review

1. Gather signals: detour rate, intervention rate, run cost, cycle time.
2. Identify patterns (require 3+ occurrences).
3. Propose change: prompt update, flow modification, or detour addition.
4. Test proposed change against historical runs.
5. Deploy with monitoring (1 week observation period).
6. Document outcome and update calibration baseline.
