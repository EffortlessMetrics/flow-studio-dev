# Panel Thinking (Anti-Goodhart)

Single metrics get gamed. Use complementary panels.

## The Rule
- Never evaluate on a single metric
- Contradictions within a panel reveal problems
- Gaming one metric should hurt another in the same panel

## Quality Panel
Tests passing + line coverage + mutation score + complexity

High coverage + low mutation score = weak tests.
