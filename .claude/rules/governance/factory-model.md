# The Factory Model

Agents are interns. The kernel is the foreman. Disk is truth.

## Components

| Component | Role | Behavior |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **Kernel** | Foreman | Deterministic. Manages time, disk, budget. Never guesses. |
| **Agents** | Interns | Brilliant, tireless. Will claim success to please. Need boundaries. |
| **Disk** | Ledger | If it isn't written, it didn't happen. |
| **Receipts** | Product | Proof of what happened. Code is a side effect. |

## The Foreman's Rules

1. **Never ask interns if they succeeded** — measure the bolt
2. **Never give them everything** — curate what they need
3. **Never trust their prose** — trust their receipts
4. **Never let them self-evaluate** — independent critics evaluate

## The Rule

> Don't chat, assign. Don't trust, verify. Don't hope, measure. Don't babysit, gate.
