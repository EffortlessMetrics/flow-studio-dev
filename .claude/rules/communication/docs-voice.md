# Documentation Voice

When writing or editing docs, follow Flow Studio voice.

## Core Rules

1. **Concrete over abstract** — Numbers, exit codes, file paths. Not "fast" or "powerful."
2. **Evidence-based claims** — Show receipts. Don't ask to be trusted.
3. **Lead with the point** — Conclusion first, then elaboration.
4. **Ruthless concision** — Every word earns its place.

## Vocabulary

**Use:** receipts, evidence, verification, factory, grinding, bottleneck
**Avoid:** revolutionary, leverage, seamless, intelligent, powerful, best-in-class, AI-powered

## Quick Test

Would a tired senior engineer at 11pm get this in 30 seconds?
