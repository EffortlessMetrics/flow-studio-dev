# Voice and Tone

How Flow Studio communicates. This isn't about brand—it's about being understood by skeptical engineers.

> This voice is modeled on Steven Zimmerman's (@EffortlessSteven) style. The characteristics below make it teachable to any contributor.

## The Voice

**Industrial operator, not Silicon Valley marketer.**

We write like someone who:
- Ships systems under real constraints (time, budgets, audits, outages)
- Treats "proof" as a file, not a feeling
- Respects the reader's time and intelligence
- Uses concrete nouns and concrete numbers

We do not sound like someone who:
- Wants to impress VCs
- Thinks buzzwords are persuasive
- Believes enthusiasm substitutes for evidence
- Has something to hide behind marketing language

## Core Characteristics

### 1. Ruthless Concision
Every word earns its place. Subject-Verb-Object. No subordinate clauses. No hedging.

Statements should read like ledger entries, not opinions.

```
❌ "Our innovative platform leverages cutting-edge AI technology to
    revolutionize the software development lifecycle."

✓  "Code generation is cheap. Trust is expensive."
```

### 2. Concrete Over Abstract
Specifics beat generalities. Numbers beat adjectives. Physical nouns over abstract concepts.

"Receipts" beats "verification logs"—tangible, auditable, easy to picture.
"Amnesia" beats "context loss"—a human condition everyone understands.

```
❌ "Significantly faster development"
✓  "$30 compute vs 5 days salary"

❌ "Robust verification"
✓  "Exit codes, test counts, coverage percentage"

❌ "Seamless integration"
✓  "Three commands to run the demo"
```

### 3. Evidence-Based Claims
We don't ask to be trusted. We show receipts.

```
❌ "Our AI produces high-quality code"
✓  "The system produces code with receipts: test results,
    coverage numbers, lint output. Judge for yourself."
```

### 4. Respectful of Skepticism
Skeptics are right to be skeptical. We agree with them, then show evidence.

```
❌ "Trust us, it works"
✓  "Don't trust us. Don't trust the AI. Trust the exit codes."
```

### 5. Warm Toward Humans, Cold Toward Artifacts
Rigorous about verification. Protective of human time and attention.

```
✓  "The system did the grinding; you do the judgment."
✓  "Exit codes don't lie. Git diffs don't hallucinate."
```

## Vocabulary

### Words We Use
| Word | Why |
|------|-----|
| Receipts | Concrete, auditable, familiar from accounting |
| Evidence | Legal/forensic weight |
| Verification | Technical precision |
| Factory | Industrial, not magical |
| Foreman | Authority from measurement, not trust |
| Grinding | Honest about what's being automated |
| Bottleneck | Engineering precision |
| Shift | Neutral, historical |

### Words We Avoid
| Word | Why |
|------|-----|
| Revolutionary | Marketing speak |
| Leverage | Corporate jargon |
| Seamless | Meaningless |
| Intelligent | Anthropomorphizes |
| Powerful | Vague |
| Best-in-class | Unverifiable |
| Game-changing | Hype |
| AI-powered | Every tool claims this now |

## Sentence Structure

Inverted pyramid: organize by importance, not chronology. The point is always *now*, never after setup.

### Lead with the point
Every paragraph starts with its conclusion.

```
❌ "When you consider the various factors involved in modern
    software development, it becomes clear that..."

✓  "Trust is the bottleneck."
```

### Use short sentences for impact
```
❌ "The system produces evidence alongside code, which allows
    reviewers to verify the output efficiently."

✓  "The system produces evidence alongside code. You verify.
    You ship."
```

### Tables for comparison
```
❌ "Traditional development takes longer and costs more than
    our approach, which produces better evidence..."

✓  | Approach | Cost | Output |
   |----------|------|--------|
   | Traditional | 5 days salary | Code you hope works |
   | Flow Studio | ~$30 compute | Code + receipts |
```

## Emotional Register

Use "we" more than "I"—it invites the audience into the work rather than positioning them as spectators. Admitting limitations builds trust; transparency is kindness.

### What we convey
- Confidence (this works, here's proof)
- Respect (your skepticism is valid)
- Pragmatism (here's the math)
- Inevitability (this transition is happening)

### What we never convey
- Hype (this changes everything!)
- Desperation (please try our product)
- Defensiveness (AI is actually good now)
- Condescension (you just don't understand)

## The Test

Before publishing, read it aloud and ask:

1. Would a tired senior engineer at 11pm get this?
2. Does every sentence earn its place?
3. Is the math concrete (~$30/run, ~30 minutes review—not "faster")?
4. Is proof before philosophy?
5. Can a skeptic verify every claim (or is it labeled unknown)?

If any answer is "no," rewrite.

## Examples

### Opening lines
```
❌ "Welcome to Flow Studio, the next-generation AI-powered
    development platform that transforms how teams build software."

✓  "The job is moving up the stack. Again."
```

### Feature descriptions
```
❌ "Our intelligent agent orchestration seamlessly coordinates
    multiple AI models to deliver optimal results."

✓  "Seven flows. Each step produces receipts. Kill it anytime.
    Resume with zero data loss."
```

### Calls to action
```
❌ "Start your journey to AI-powered development today!"

✓  "Run `make demo-run`. See what done looks like."
```

## Remember

**Target reader:** The exhausted Senior Engineer with 5 minutes between meetings who just wants the answer.

We're not selling software. We're explaining a transition that's already happening and showing what it looks like to navigate it well.

The voice should sound like someone who's already through to the other side, looking back and explaining the path.
