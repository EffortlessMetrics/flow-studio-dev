# Secret Detection and Response

**"Detect before escape. Respond immediately."**

This rule covers secret detection patterns and exposure response protocols. For secret categories, storage, and rotation, see [secret-management.md](./secret-management.md).

## Detection Patterns

### Pre-Commit Hook Patterns

Scan for secrets before they enter git history:

```python
SECRET_PATTERNS = [
    # API Keys
    (r'sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{48}', 'OpenAI API key'),
    (r'sk-ant-[A-Za-z0-9-]{95}', 'Anthropic API key'),
    (r'ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}', 'GitHub personal access token'),
    (r'gho_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}', 'GitHub OAuth token'),
    (r'ghs_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}', 'GitHub App token'),
    (r'AKIA[A-Z0-9]{16}', 'AWS access key'),
    (r'xox[baprs]-[A-Za-z0-9-]+', 'Slack token'),
    (r'sk_live_[A-Za-z0-9]{24,}', 'Stripe live key'),

    # Credentials in code
    (r'password\s*[=:]\s*["\'][^"\']{8,}["\']', 'Hardcoded password'),
    (r'secret\s*[=:]\s*["\'][^"\']{8,}["\']', 'Hardcoded secret'),
    (r'api_key\s*[=:]\s*["\'][^"\']{8,}["\']', 'Hardcoded API key'),
    (r'token\s*[=:]\s*["\'][^"\']{16,}["\']', 'Hardcoded token'),

    # Private keys
    (r'-----BEGIN (RSA |DSA |EC |OPENSSH )?PRIVATE KEY-----', 'Private key'),
    (r'-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----', 'PGP private key'),

    # Connection strings with credentials
    (r'(mysql|postgresql|mongodb)://[^:]+:[^@]+@', 'Database connection with password'),
    (r'redis://:[^@]+@', 'Redis connection with password'),
]
```

### CI Scanning

Run secret detection on every PR:

```yaml
# Example: GitHub Actions with gitleaks
- name: Scan for secrets
  uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Flow 6 Boundary Scan

Before pushing to upstream, scan the diff:

```bash
# Scan only the changes being pushed
git diff upstream/main...HEAD | grep -E \
  'sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{48}|sk-ant-|ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}|AKIA[A-Z0-9]{16}|-----BEGIN .* PRIVATE KEY-----'
```

**Action on detection:** Block push, require removal.

## Exposure Response Protocol

### Step 1: Revoke Immediately

| Provider | Revocation Method |
|----------|-------------------|
| OpenAI | API Keys page in dashboard |
| Anthropic | Console > API Keys |
| GitHub | Settings > Developer settings > Tokens |
| AWS | IAM > Users > Security credentials |

**Do not wait.** Revoke first, assess second.

### Step 2: Rotate Affected Secrets

After revocation, generate new credentials:
1. Create new secret
2. Update all systems using the secret
3. Verify new secret works
4. Delete/disable old secret (if not already)

### Step 3: Audit Access Logs

Check for unauthorized usage during exposure window:

| Service | Log Location |
|---------|--------------|
| OpenAI | Usage dashboard |
| Anthropic | Console > Usage |
| GitHub | Security log |
| AWS | CloudTrail |

Look for:
- Unusual request patterns
- Requests from unexpected IPs
- Elevated permission usage
- Resource creation/deletion

### Step 4: Assess Blast Radius

Document the exposure:
- What secret was exposed?
- How long was it exposed?
- Where was it exposed? (commit, log, etc.)
- What access did it grant?
- What actions were taken with it?
- What data was potentially accessed?

### Step 5: Remediate Source

If secret was in commit history:
```bash
# For recent commits (not yet pushed)
git rebase -i HEAD~N  # Remove the secret

# For pushed commits (requires force push to feature branch)
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/secret/file' \
  --prune-empty HEAD

# Or use BFG Repo Cleaner (faster)
bfg --delete-files secrets.txt
bfg --replace-text passwords.txt
```

**Warning:** Never force push to protected branches. If secret is in main branch history, consider it permanently exposed.

## Flow Studio Specifics

### LLM API Keys

LLM provider keys power the swarm. Handle with care:

```bash
# Set in environment, never in config
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."

# Verify keys are not in config
grep -r "sk-ant-\|sk-[A-Za-z0-9]\{48\}" swarm/ .claude/
```

**Never commit:**
- API keys in `.claude/settings.json`
- Keys in flow configs
- Keys in runbook examples

### GitHub Tokens for repo-operator

The `repo-operator` agent needs GitHub access:

```bash
# Use GitHub CLI authentication (preferred)
gh auth login

# Or set token in environment
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_..."
export GH_TOKEN="ghp_..."  # gh CLI also checks this
```

**Required scopes for repo-operator:**
- `repo` (full repository access)
- `workflow` (for CI triggers)
- `read:org` (for org-level operations)

### Secrets in Receipts and Logs

Receipts and logs are audit artifacts. They MUST NOT contain secrets.

**Redaction in logs:**
```python
def redact_secrets(text: str) -> str:
    """Redact known secret patterns from text."""
    patterns = [
        (r'sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{48}', '[REDACTED:OPENAI_KEY]'),
        (r'sk-ant-[A-Za-z0-9-]{95}', '[REDACTED:ANTHROPIC_KEY]'),
        (r'ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}', '[REDACTED:GITHUB_TOKEN]'),
        (r'password=[^\s&]+', 'password=[REDACTED]'),
    ]
    for pattern, replacement in patterns:
        text = re.sub(pattern, replacement, text)
    return text
```

**Apply redaction:**
- Before writing receipts
- Before writing transcripts
- Before logging command output
- Before error messages

### Environment Verification

Before running flows, verify secret hygiene:

```bash
# Check: secrets not in tree
! grep -rE 'sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{48}|sk-ant-|ghp_' --include='*.py' --include='*.yaml' --include='*.json' .

# Check: .env is gitignored
git check-ignore .env  # Should output ".env"

# Check: required secrets are set (not empty)
[ -n "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" ] || echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set"
[ -n "$GITHUB_TOKEN" ] || echo "GITHUB_TOKEN not set"
```
