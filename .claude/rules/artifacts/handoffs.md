# Handoffs

Handoffs transfer state between steps. Right-size to purpose.

## Sizing

| Type | Tokens | Use |
|------|--------|-----|
| Minimal | <500 | Microloop iterations (critic → author) |
| Standard | 500-2000 | Sequential steps (N → N+1) |
| Heavy | 2000-5000 | Flow boundaries (Plan → Build) |

## The Rule

- Summarize, point, structure. Never transcribe.
- Pointers over content. Structure over prose.
- Minimal handoffs: ONE issue with file:line
- Placement: `RUN_BASE/<flow>/handoffs/<step_id>-<agent_key>.json`
