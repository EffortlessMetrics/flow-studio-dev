## Why This Exists

The job is moving up the stack. Again.

```
Punchcards → Assembly → High-level languages → Now
```

Each transition followed the same pattern: what was once skilled craft becomes mechanical, and humans move to higher-leverage work. Programmers stopped managing memory addresses. Then stopped thinking in registers. Now they stop grinding on first-draft implementation.

**The shift:** Models write nearly-working code at 1,000+ tokens/second. The bottleneck isn't generation—it's *trust*. Can a human review and trust the output in 30 minutes instead of spending a week doing it themselves?

**Flow Studio addresses that constraint.** It produces forensic evidence alongside code. You audit the evidence, escalate verification at hotspots where doubt exists, and ship—or bounce it back for another iteration.

The machine does the implementation. You do the architecture, the intent, the judgment.

Just like every transition before.

## What Flow Studio Does

Flow Studio runs **7 sequential flows** that transform a requirement into a merged PR:

| Flow | Transformation | Output |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **Signal** | Raw input → structured problem | Requirements, BDD scenarios, risk assessment |
| **Plan** | Requirements → architecture | ADR, contracts, work plan, test plan |
| **Build** | Plan → working code | Implementation + tests via adversarial loops |
| **Review** | Draft PR → Ready PR | Harvest feedback, apply fixes |
| **Gate** | Code → merge decision | Audit receipts, policy check, recommendation |
| **Deploy** | Approved → production | Merge, verify health, audit trail |
| **Wisdom** | Artifacts → learnings | Pattern detection, feedback loops |

Each flow produces **receipts** (proof of execution) and **evidence** (test results, coverage, lint output). Kill the process anytime—resume from the last checkpoint with zero data loss.

---

## The Economics

| Approach | Cost | Output |
|----------|------|--------|
| Developer implements feature | 5 days of salary | Code you hope works |
| Flow Studio runs overnight | ~$30 compute | Code + tests + receipts + evidence panel + hotspot list |

The receipts are the product. The code is a side effect.

## Installation

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip
- GNU Make (Linux/macOS: included; Windows: use WSL2 or [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/))
- Node.js 20+ (optional, for UI development)

**Install:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/flow-studio-swarm.git
cd flow-studio-swarm
uv sync --extra dev
```

**Verify:**

```bash
make dev-check    # Should pass all checks
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
make demo-run       # Populate example artifacts
make flow-studio    # Start UI → http://localhost:5000
```

Open: **http://localhost:5000/?run=demo-health-check&mode=operator**

You'll see:
- **Left**: 7 flows (Signal → Plan → Build → Review → Gate → Deploy → Wisdom)
- **Center**: Step graph showing what ran and what it produced
- **Right**: Evidence, artifacts, and agent details

The demo shows a complete run—all seven flows executed, all receipts captured. Click around. This is what "done" looks like.

---

## What You Get

Every completed run produces:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Receipts** | Forensic proof of what happened—commands run, exit codes, timing |
| **Evidence panel** | Multi-metric dashboard (tests, coverage, lint, security) that resists gaming |
| **Hotspots** | The 3-8 files a reviewer should actually look at |
| **Bounded diff** | The change itself, with clear scope |
| **Explicit unknowns** | What wasn't measured, what's still risky |

A reviewer answers three questions in under 5 minutes:

1. **Does evidence exist and is it fresh?**
2. **Does the panel of metrics agree?**
3. **Where would I escalate verification?**

If yes, approve. If contradictions, investigate. The system did the grinding.

## The Mental Model

Don't anthropomorphize the AI as a "copilot." View it as a manufacturing plant.

| Component | Role | Behavior |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **Python Kernel** | Factory Foreman | Deterministic. Manages time, disk, budget. Never guesses. |
| **Agents** | Enthusiastic Interns | Brilliant, tireless. Will claim success to please you. Need boundaries. |
| **Disk** | Ledger | If it isn't written, it didn't happen. |
| **Receipts** | Audit Trail | The actual product. |

**The foreman's job:**
- Don't ask interns if they succeeded—measure the bolt
- Don't give them everything—curate what they need
- Don't trust their prose—trust their receipts

This is why the system doesn't rely on agent claims and runs forensic scanners. Exit codes don't lie. Git diffs don't hallucinate.

---

## Architecture

Three planes, cleanly separated:

| Plane | Component | What it does |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Control** | Python kernel | State machine, budgets, atomic disk commits |
| **Execution** | Claude Agent SDK | Autonomous work in a sandbox |
| **Projection** | DuckDB | Queryable index for the UI |

The kernel is deterministic. The agent is stochastic. The database is ephemeral (rebuildable from the event journal).

**Step lifecycle:**
1. **Work** — Agent executes with full autonomy
2. **Finalize** — Structured handoff envelope extracted from hot context
3. **Route** — Next step determined from forensic evidence, not prose

Flow Studio orchestrates work in repos of any language. It's implemented in Python (kernel) and TypeScript (UI).

## Key Principles

| Principle | What it means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Forensics over narrative** | Trust the git diff, the test log, the receipt. Not the agent's claim. |
| **Verification is the product** | Output is code + the evidence needed to trust it. |
| **Steps, not sessions** | Each step has one job in fresh context. No 100k-token confusion. |
| **Adversarial loops** | Critics find problems. Authors fix them. They never agree to be nice. |
| **Resumable by default** | Kill anytime. Resume from last checkpoint. Zero data loss. |

## Commands

```bash
make dev-check          # Validate swarm health (run before commits)
make selftest           # Full 16-step validation
make kernel-smoke       # Fast kernel check (~300ms)
make stepwise-sdlc-stub # Zero-cost demo run
make help               # All commands
```
