./docs/archive/DEMO_SWARM_COMPREHENSIVE_WALKTHROUGH.md:3:> **Purpose**: This document synthesizes all previous architectural analyses into a cohesive narrative that explains the demo-swarm-dev repository's design, implementation, and evolution.
./docs/archive/DEMO_SWARM_COMPREHENSIVE_WALKTHROUGH.md:11:The demo-swarm-dev repository implements a sophisticated agentic Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) system that demonstrates how to build governed, auditable, and extensible AI-assisted development workflows. The system trades compute for human attention through structured flows, adversarial microloops, and comprehensive governance frameworks.
./docs/archive/DEMO_SWARM_COMPREHENSIVE_WALKTHROUGH.md:576:The demo-swarm-dev repository demonstrates how to build **governed agentic SDLC systems** that:
./docs/archive/DEMO_SWARM_COMPREHENSIVE_WALKTHROUGH.md:608:The demo-swarm-dev repository represents a sophisticated approach to agentic SDLC that prioritizes **governance, auditability, and extensibility** over raw capability. The six-flow architecture, combined with adversarial microloops and three-tier validation, creates a system where AI agents handle routine work while humans focus on strategic decisions and system improvements.
