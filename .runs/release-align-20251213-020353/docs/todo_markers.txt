docs/SELFTEST_SYSTEM.md:59:  Then the exit code should be 0 or 1
docs/SELFTEST_SYSTEM.md:236:**Why**: Lets you merge work-in-progress or temporary fixes while the governance team fixes the underlying issue (e.g., a stray Gherkin comment, a documentation gap).

swarm/SELFTEST_SYSTEM.md:399:For temporary, human-approved exceptions:
swarm/SELFTEST_SYSTEM.md:422:- Use responsibly; overrides should be temporary workarounds, not permanent bypasses
swarm/SELFTEST_SYSTEM.md:657:- **GOVERNANCE failures**: Decide (merge with known issues, or bounce to Build)
swarm/SELFTEST_SYSTEM.md:743:**Option 2**: Use degraded mode (temporary, during development)
swarm/SELFTEST_SYSTEM.md:792:# Create temporary override (24 hours)
swarm/SELFTEST_SYSTEM.md:840:   - Transparent temporary exceptions
swarm/SELFTEST_SYSTEM.md:841:   - Built-in expiration prevents "permanent" workarounds
docs/LONG_RUNNING_HARNESSES.md:27:Anthropic recommends **initializer agents** that set up context, frame the problem, and establish constraints before coding begins. These agents should load heavy context upfront (20-50k tokens) because "compute is cheap; reducing downstream re-search saves attention."
docs/LONG_RUNNING_HARNESSES.md:96:Anthropic recommends **verification agents** that audit artifacts, enforce policies, and make go/no-go decisions. These agents should not fix substantive issues; they verify and report.
docs/LONG_RUNNING_HARNESSES.md:115:This enforces the principle that verification agents should not become "Build 2.0"--they audit the gravity well's shape, not fill it in.

docs/VALIDATION_WALKTHROUGH.md:653:In default mode, certain design guidelines (like "domain agents should omit `tools:` and `permissionMode:` fields") generate warnings.

docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md:70:**Expected output**: `dev-check` should exit with code 0 (success) or 1 (validation failure). If you see code 2, there's a configuration error—fix that first before proceeding.

docs/FLOW_STUDIO.md:741:**Why?** Flow Studio is a demo harness. Users should be able to run it immediately after cloning without setting up a Node.js toolchain. Silent failures from missing JS assets (the bug this contract prevents) are worse than the minor overhead of committing compiled output.

docs/SELFTEST_OWNERSHIP.md:680:- Degraded mode is a conscious workaround; exit 0 signals "this is expected"
docs/SELFTEST_OWNERSHIP.md:852:2. **Graceful Degradation over Hard Blocks**: GOVERNANCE failures allow `--degraded` workarounds. KERNEL failures block immediately.
docs/SELFTEST_GOVERNANCE.md:116:- Use this **only for short-term workarounds** (e.g., waiting for a new agent to be fully onboarded)
docs/SELFTEST_GOVERNANCE.md:313:2. **Example**: Agent config is being migrated, causing a temporary mismatch in `agents-governance` check
