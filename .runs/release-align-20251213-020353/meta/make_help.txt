Flow Studio demo harness — Essential Commands

Getting started:
  make demo-swarm          # One-command demo: validate, stepwise run, Flow Studio
  make demo-flow-studio    # Quick demo: sync, populate, launch Flow Studio
  make demo-selftest       # Governance introspection demo (selftest + Flow Studio)
  make dev-check           # Full validation (adapters, flows, selftest)
  make demo-run            # Populate example run at swarm/runs/demo-health-check/
  make flow-studio         # Flow visualization at http://localhost:5000

Validation & testing:
  make test                # Alias for selftest (full swarm selftest)
  make selftest-fast       # Fast KERNEL-only check (~400ms)
  make selftest            # Full swarm selftest (16 steps)

Pytest test taxonomy (by marks):
  make test-unit           # Unit tests (isolated logic, no I/O)
  make test-integration    # Integration tests (CLI, file I/O)
  make test-slow           # Slow tests (>1s, full subprocess)
  make test-quick          # Quick tests (<100ms, unit + mocks)
  make test-all            # All pytest tests
  make selftest-distributed  # Parallel selftest with wave-based execution
  make selftest-govern     # Governance checks only (no code tests)
  make selftest-doctor     # Diagnose selftest failures
  make selftest-suggest-remediation  # Suggest fixes for degradations
  make selftest-remediate            # Execute remediations with approval
  make selftest-incident-pack        # Generate diagnostic tarball for incidents
  make check-ac-freshness  # Validate AC matrix consistency
  make quick-check         # Validator only (no selftest)
  make ci-validate         # CI gate: fail on validation errors
  make ci-validate-strict  # CI gate: fail on warnings too

Exit codes: 0 = OK, 1 = validation failed, 2 = fatal error

Agent & flow ops:
  make agents-help         # Agent configuration workflow
  make flows-help          # Flow commands
  make agents-models       # Show model distribution

Stepwise backends:
  make demo-run-stepwise   # Demo both stepwise backends
  make stepwise-help       # Stepwise backend help

Agent SDK:
  make agent-sdk-ts-demo   # Run TypeScript Agent SDK example
  make agent-sdk-py-demo   # Run Python Agent SDK example
  make agent-sdk-help      # Agent SDK documentation

Maintenance:
  make runs-clean          # Clean stale runs from swarm/runs/
  make wisdom-cycle        # Aggregate wisdom, preview cleanup
