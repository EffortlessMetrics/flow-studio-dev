# Tags for Staging/Development Only
# These tags should NOT be pushed to production repository
# They represent legacy demo-swarm iterations or pre-release Flow Studio versions

# Legacy demo-swarm tags (v1.x era - before v2.0 release)
demo-swarm-v1-final       d9e4f19  Flow 3 + Flow 4: Validator hardening and operationalization
demo-swarm-v1-polish      2d134a0  Polished demo-swarm reference implementation
demo-swarm-v1-validated   40550ef  Flow 3 + 4 complete: validator hardened, tested, and operationalized

# Pre-release Flow Studio tags (v0.x era - before v2.0 integration)
v0.4.0-flowstudio         e03f658  Flow Studio TS UI + runbooks + validation UX
v0.4.1-flowstudio         18eb838  Flow Studio a11y + SDK contract tests
v0.6.0-flowstudio         6efbd72  flowstudio: profiles + registry integration (v0.6)

# Rationale:
# - demo-swarm-* tags: Historical snapshots from when this was "demo-swarm" repo
#   These predate the v2.0.0 release and Flow Studio integration
# - v0.x-flowstudio tags: Pre-release Flow Studio development before v2.0 merge
#   Superseded by v2.x integrated releases

# Status: ⚠️  DO NOT PUSH TO PRODUCTION
# These tags are valuable for staging history but not relevant to production releases
