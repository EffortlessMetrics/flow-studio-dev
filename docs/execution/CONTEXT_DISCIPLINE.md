# Context Discipline

Intelligence degrades as irrelevant history grows.

## Session Amnesia

Each step starts fresh. Rehydrate from artifacts, not conversation.

## Loading Hierarchy

1. CRITICAL: Teaching notes (never drop)
2. HIGH: Previous step output (truncate if needed)
3. MEDIUM: Referenced artifacts (on-demand)
4. LOW: History summary (drop first)

## Rules

- Disk is memory; chat is ephemeral
- Heavy context loaders (20-50k) are multipliers: one reads, ten benefit
