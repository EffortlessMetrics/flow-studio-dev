# CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you diagnose and resolve CI/CD issues in the Swarm demo repo. Whether a check is failing in GitHub Actions or you need to reproduce an issue locally, start here.

**Quick links:**
- **Selftest diagnostic**: `make selftest-doctor` — Separates harness issues from code issues
- **AC freshness check**: `make check-ac-freshness` — Validates AC matrix alignment
- **All workflows**: `.github/workflows/` — Three main CI workflows

---

## Quick Reference: CI Jobs and Local Commands

This table maps every CI job to its local equivalent. Use it to reproduce CI failures on your machine.

| CI Job | Workflow | Local Command | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------------|---------|
| **validate-swarm** | `ci.yml` | `make validate-swarm` | Validate agent/flow spec alignment |
| **test-swarm** | `ci.yml` | `uv run pytest` | Run Python unit and integration tests |
| **[GOVERNANCE] Check AC Matrix Freshness** | `selftest-governance-gate.yml` | `make check-ac-freshness` | Validate AC matrix is in sync with implementation |
| **[GOVERNANCE] Run AC Tests** | `selftest-governance-gate.yml` | `uv run pytest tests/test_selftest_ac_*.py -v` | Run AC bijection, API contract, traceability tests |
| **[GOVERNANCE] Run Degradation Tests** | `selftest-governance-gate.yml` | `uv run pytest tests/test_selftest_degradation_*.py -v` | Run degradation schema, CLI, and status coherence tests |
| **[OPTIONAL] Run Selftest Doctor** | `selftest-governance-gate.yml` | `make selftest-doctor` | Diagnostic tool (informational, non-blocking) |

---

## Reproducing CI Issues Locally

### 1. Set Up the Same Environment as CI

CI uses Python 3.13 with UV for dependency management. Replicate this locally:

```bash
# Install uv if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.13+

# Sync dependencies with frozen lockfile (same as CI)
uv sync --frozen

# Optional: Include dev dependencies for testing
uv sync --frozen --extra dev
```

### 2. Run the Same Commands as CI

Run the exact commands that CI runs, in the same order:

**Basic validation (from ci.yml):**

```bash
# Step 1: Validate swarm spec
make validate-swarm

# Step 2: Run Python tests
uv run pytest
```

**Governance gate (from selftest-governance-gate.yml):**

```bash
# Step 1: AC matrix freshness
make check-ac-freshness

# Step 2: AC-related tests
uv run pytest \
  tests/test_selftest_ac_bijection.py \
  tests/test_selftest_ac_traceability.py \
  tests/test_selftest_api_contract.py \
  tests/test_selftest_api_contract_coherence.py \
  -v --tb=short --color=yes

# Step 3: Degradation system tests
uv run pytest \
  tests/test_selftest_degradation_schema_compliance.py \
  tests/test_selftest_degradations_cli_contract.py \
  tests/test_selftest_status_degradation_coherence.py \
  tests/test_selftest_degradation_log.py \
  -v --tb=short --color=yes
```

**Full development check (combines all):**

```bash
make dev-check
```

### 3. Isolate the Problem

If a test is failing, isolate which step:

```bash
# Run just one test file
uv run pytest tests/test_selftest_ac_bijection.py -v

# Run one specific test
uv run pytest tests/test_selftest_ac_bijection.py::test_ac_exists_in_matrix -v

# Show full output and stack traces
uv run pytest tests/test_selftest_ac_bijection.py -vv --tb=long
```

### 4. Get Diagnostics

Use diagnostic tools to understand what's happening:

```bash
# Diagnose selftest harness vs service issues
make selftest-doctor

# Get verbose AC freshness output
make check-ac-freshness-verbose

# Show selftest plan without running it
uv run swarm/tools/selftest.py --plan

# Run selftest in degraded mode (skip non-blocking checks)
make selftest-degraded
```

---

## Exit Code Meanings

The CI system uses standard Unix exit codes. Understand what each means:

| Exit Code | Meaning | CI Behavior | Next Steps |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **0** | All checks passed | Merge allowed | None; all good |
| **1** | Validation or test failure | Merge blocked | Review failure, fix code, push again |
| **2** | Fatal error (environment issue, not code) | Merge blocked | Check environment (missing files, bad lockfile, etc.) |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Exit 0: All clear
$ make validate-swarm
✓ All validation checks passed
$ echo $?
0

# Exit 1: Validation failed (fixable)
$ make validate-swarm
✗ Agent 'foo-bar' has color 'blue' but role family 'spec' expects 'purple'
$ echo $?
1

# Exit 2: Fatal error (environment problem)
$ uv run pytest
fatal: python not found
$ echo $?
2
```

---

## Common Failures and Solutions

### "pytest not found" / "ModuleNotFoundError"

**Symptom:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytest'
```

**Cause:** Dependencies are not installed.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Sync dependencies with dev extras
uv sync --frozen --extra dev

# Verify pytest is available
uv run pytest --version
```

---

### "AC matrix out of sync"

**Symptom:**
```
✗ AC FRESHNESS: AC matrix in docs/SELFTEST_AC_MATRIX.md is out of sync with implementation
```

**Cause:** The AC matrix documentation doesn't match the actual acceptance criteria in the code.

**Solution:**

1. Check what changed:
   ```bash
   make check-ac-freshness-verbose
   ```

2. Review the differences between spec and implementation

3. Update the AC matrix to match implementation:
   ```bash
   # Regenerate the matrix (if you have a tool for it)
   # or manually edit docs/SELFTEST_AC_MATRIX.md
   $EDITOR docs/SELFTEST_AC_MATRIX.md
   ```

4. Verify the fix:
   ```bash
   make check-ac-freshness
   ```

---

### "Degradation schema mismatch"

**Symptom:**
```
test_selftest_degradation_schema_compliance.py::test_degradation_schema FAILED
AssertionError: Expected field 'reason' in degradation entry, got: ...
```

**Cause:** A degradation entry in the degradation log doesn't match the expected schema.

**Solution:**

1. Check the degradation log:
   ```bash
   # Show current degradations
   uv run swarm/tools/show_selftest_degradations.py
   ```

2. Review the failing test to understand the schema:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/test_selftest_degradation_schema_compliance.py -vv
   ```

3. Fix the degradation entry in the degradation log file (usually `swarm/runs/<run-id>/degradations.json`)

4. Re-run the test:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/test_selftest_degradation_schema_compliance.py -v
   ```

---

### "Git history too shallow"

**Symptom:**
```
✗ AC FRESHNESS: Cannot check freshness; git history is too shallow
  (need full history, got depth 1)
```

**Cause:** CI cloned with `fetch-depth: 1` (shallow), but AC freshness check needs full history.

**Solution:**

In your CI workflow, ensure `fetch-depth: 0` (full history):

```yaml
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0  # Full history for AC freshness checks
```

---

### "validator-failed" / Swarm spec validation error

**Symptom:**
```
✗ BIJECTION: swarm/AGENTS.md:line 42: Agent 'foo-bar' is registered but
  .claude/agents/foo-bar.md does not exist
```

**Cause:** Agent registry and agent files are out of sync.

**Solution:**

1. Check what's wrong:
   ```bash
   make validate-swarm
   # or for machine-readable output:
   uv run swarm/tools/validate_swarm.py --json | jq '.summary'
   ```

2. Fix the issue (examples):
   - **Missing agent file**: Create `.claude/agents/<key>.md` or remove from registry
   - **Color mismatch**: Update `color:` in agent frontmatter to match role family
   - **Bad YAML**: Check frontmatter syntax (make sure `---` markers are correct)

3. Verify the fix:
   ```bash
   make validate-swarm
   ```

---

### "Tests pass locally but fail in CI"

**Symptom:** Your local `uv run pytest` passes, but `test-swarm` job fails in CI.

**Diagnosis:**

This usually means:
1. Different Python version locally vs CI (check `python --version`)
2. Different dependency versions (run `uv sync --frozen` to match CI lockfile)
3. Different working directory or file paths
4. Timing-dependent flakiness (test passes sometimes, not always)

**Solution:**

```bash
# Replicate CI environment exactly
python --version  # Should be 3.13
uv sync --frozen --extra dev

# Run the same test command as CI
uv run pytest -v --tb=short

# If still failing, check for flakiness
uv run pytest -v --tb=short --count=5  # Run 5 times
```

---

### "Flaky tests" / Intermittent failures

**Symptom:** A test passes sometimes and fails sometimes, no obvious pattern.

**Diagnosis:**

Flaky tests often indicate:
- Race conditions (tests running in parallel)
- File system timing (files not written/read in time)
- Network requests (timeouts, DNS issues)
- Random seed issues (random order of operations)

**Solution:**

```bash
# Run tests sequentially (not in parallel)
uv run pytest -v --tb=short -n0  # Disable parallelization

# Run with fixed random seed
uv run pytest -v --tb=short --random-order-seed=12345

# Run the test multiple times
uv run pytest tests/test_selftest_api_contract.py -v --count=10

# Get diagnostics
make selftest-doctor
```

---

## Pre-flight Checks: What CI Validates

Before any test runs, CI validates the environment. Understanding these checks helps you debug setup issues:

### Required Files Exist

CI expects these files to be present:

```bash
# Check for required files
test -f uv.lock          # Python dependency lockfile
test -f pyproject.toml   # Python project metadata
test -f Makefile         # Build targets
test -d .github/workflows/  # CI workflows
test -d swarm/           # Swarm framework
test -d .claude/         # Agent and skill definitions
```

If any are missing, you'll see exit code 2 (fatal).

**Fix:**
```bash
# Regenerate missing files if they were deleted
git checkout uv.lock pyproject.toml Makefile
```

### pytest Can Discover Tests

CI runs `uv run pytest` without specifying test files, so pytest must auto-discover them:

```bash
# Check that pytest can find tests
uv run pytest --collect-only

# If discovery fails, check:
# - All test files are named test_*.py or *_test.py
# - All test functions are named test_*()
# - __init__.py files exist in test directories (if needed)
```

### Git History Depth Is Sufficient

AC freshness checks need full git history:

```bash
# Check git history depth
git log --oneline | wc -l

# If depth is 1, you have a shallow clone
# Fix with: git fetch --unshallow
git fetch --unshallow
```

### uv Dependencies Are Locked

CI uses `uv sync --frozen`, which requires an up-to-date lockfile:

```bash
# Check if lockfile is current
uv lock --check

# If not, regenerate
uv lock
```

---

## Diagnostic Tools and Commands

When things go wrong, use these tools to understand why:

### selftest-doctor: Diagnose Harness vs Service Issues

Separates environmental/harness problems from actual code failures:

```bash
make selftest-doctor
```

**Output explains:**
- HARNESS_ISSUE: Infrastructure problem (Python, uv, git, etc.)
- SERVICE_ISSUE: Code or test failure
- UNKNOWN: Couldn't determine the type

**Example output:**
```
Diagnostic Report
=================
Status: HARNESS_ISSUE
Reason: uv not found in PATH
Action: Install uv: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Verbose AC Freshness Check

Get detailed output on AC matrix alignment:

```bash
make check-ac-freshness-verbose
```

**Shows:**
- Which ACs are in the matrix
- Which ACs are in the implementation
- Specific mismatches with line numbers

### Selftest Plan (No Execution)

See what will run without actually running it:

```bash
uv run swarm/tools/selftest.py --plan
```

**Output shows:**
- All 16 steps
- Which tier each belongs to (KERNEL, GOVERNANCE, OPTIONAL)
- Dependencies between steps
- Estimated runtime

### Selftest with JSON Output

Get machine-readable diagnostics:

```bash
uv run swarm/tools/selftest.py --json | jq '.summary'
```

**Shows:**
- Exit code
- Which steps passed/failed
- Detailed failure reasons with fix suggestions

### Validation in JSON Mode

Machine-readable validation output for tools/dashboards:

```bash
uv run swarm/tools/validate_swarm.py --json | jq '.summary'
```

## When to Ask for Help

If you've tried the above and the issue persists, here's how to get help and what information to include:

### Issue Only Happens in CI (Not Locally)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Run `uv sync --frozen` locally (match CI's lockfile)
- [ ] Verify `python --version` is 3.13+
- [ ] Check `git log --oneline | wc -l` is > 1 (full history)
- [ ] Run the exact CI command: `make dev-check`

**Information to include when asking for help:**
```bash
# Capture environment info
python --version
uv --version
git log --oneline | wc -l
uv run pytest --version

# Capture the failure
make dev-check 2>&1 | tee ci-failure.log

# Capture diagnostics
make selftest-doctor > diagnostics.txt 2>&1

# Share the logs and diagnostics
```

### Exit Code 2 (Fatal Error, Not Code Issue)

Exit code 2 means the test harness itself has a problem, not your code.

**Likely causes:**
- Python not installed or wrong version
- uv not in PATH
- Required file missing (uv.lock, pyproject.toml)
- Git repository corrupted
- Disk full or permission denied

**How to debug:**
```bash
# Check Python
python --version  # Should be 3.13+
which python

# Check uv
which uv
uv --version

# Check required files
ls -la uv.lock pyproject.toml

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check git
git log -1 --oneline
git status
```

### Flaky Tests That Fail Intermittently

Save diagnostics for the next failure:

```bash
# Run test in a loop and capture first failure
for i in {1..20}; do
  echo "Run $i..."
  uv run pytest tests/test_selftest_api_contract.py -v || {
    echo "FAILED on run $i"
    make selftest-doctor > diagnostics-run-$i.txt
    break
  }
done
```

**Information to include:**
- How many times does it fail? (1/10 runs? 3/20 runs?)
- Is there a pattern? (fails when run after other tests? always on main branch?)
- Any recent changes to test files or dependencies?

## Troubleshooting Flowchart

```
Does make dev-check pass locally?
│
├─ YES → Issue only happens in CI
│        └─ Check environment differences:
│           • Python version (python --version)
│           • uv version (uv --version)
│           • Git history (git log | wc -l)
│           • Run: uv sync --frozen
│
└─ NO → Issue happens locally
         │
         └─ What's the exit code?
            │
            ├─ Exit 0 (passed) → Intermittent/flaky
            │  └─ Run 5 times: make dev-check && make dev-check && ...
            │
            ├─ Exit 1 (test failure) → Reproducible failure
            │  └─ Isolate which step:
            │     • make validate-swarm
            │     • make selftest-doctor
            │     • uv run pytest tests/test_*.py -v
            │
            └─ Exit 2 (fatal error) → Environment problem
               └─ Check:
                  • python --version (need 3.13+)
                  • which uv (need in PATH)
                  • ls -la uv.lock (must exist)
                  • git log (full history needed)
```

## Common GitHub Actions Failures and Fixes

These failures are specific to GitHub Actions CI environment:

### "python not found" in CI

**Cause:** Python version not set up correctly in workflow.

**Fix:** Ensure workflow has setup-python step:

```yaml
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: "3.13"
```

### "uv: command not found" in CI

**Cause:** uv not installed or not in PATH.

**Fix:** Ensure workflow installs uv:

```yaml
- name: Install uv
  run: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Workflow times out

**Cause:** A step runs too long (default 6 hours, jobs can set shorter timeouts).

**Check the workflow file for timeout-minutes:**

```yaml
jobs:
  validate-swarm:
    timeout-minutes: 5  # 5 minute timeout
```

**Fix:** Either optimize the step or increase timeout (if reasonable).

### Shallow clone breaks AC freshness

**Cause:** Checkout uses `fetch-depth: 1` but AC freshness needs full history.

**Fix:** Use `fetch-depth: 0`:

```yaml
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0  # Full history
```

## Workflow Files Reference

For quick lookup, here are the three main CI workflows:

| Workflow | File | Runs On | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| **Basic CI** | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Every push/PR | Validates swarm spec, runs Python tests |
| **Swarm Validation** | `.github/workflows/swarm-validate.yml` | Changes to `swarm/` or `.claude/` | Strict validation on main, lenient on PRs |
| **Selftest Governance Gate** | `.github/workflows/selftest-governance-gate.yml` | Changes to selftest infra | AC matrix, AC tests, degradation tests |

**View workflow status:**

```bash
# List all workflows
gh workflow list

# Check status of a specific workflow
gh workflow view selftest-governance-gate.yml

# View last run
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml

# View specific run details
gh run view <run-id>
```

## Quick Command Reference

For easy copy-paste:

```bash
# Reproduce CI locally
uv sync --frozen
make dev-check

# Diagnose issues
make selftest-doctor
make check-ac-freshness-verbose

# Run specific test suites
uv run pytest tests/test_selftest_ac_bijection.py -v
