"""
port.py - Transport port interface for stepwise execution.

This module defines the abstract contract that all step execution transports
must implement. The contract is designed around the WP6 per-step session pattern:

1. Transport.open_session() - Create a session for a step
2. Session.work() - Execute the work phase
3. Session.finalize() - Extract structured handoff envelope
4. Session.route() - Determine next step routing

Transports can implement these with different backends:
- Claude Agent SDK (primary, full-featured)
- Claude CLI (debugging, fallback)
- Gemini CLI (alternative provider)
- Stub (testing, CI)

Each transport declares its capabilities so the orchestrator can adapt.

class TransportCapabilities:
    """Declares what features a transport supports.

    Used by the orchestrator to adapt its behavior based on transport features.
    Transports that don't support a feature should gracefully degrade.

    Session Semantics:
        Flow Studio operates with "session amnesia" - each step starts fresh and
        rehydrates context from disk artifacts. This is intentional for auditability
        and resumability. The distinction between within-step and across-step context
        is important:

        - Within-step (Work→Finalize→Route): Can share conversation state
        - Across-steps (Step N→N+1): Always rehydrates from artifacts

    Attributes:
        supports_output_format: Whether transport supports structured JSON output
            via output_format parameter. If True, finalize/route can use schema
            validation instead of parsing from markdown fences.
        supports_interrupts: Whether transport supports mid-execution interrupts.
            If True, sessions can be interrupted and partial results recovered.
        supports_hooks: Whether transport supports pre/post tool hooks.
            If True, hooks can be registered for foot-gun blocking and telemetry.
        supports_sandbox: Whether transport enforces sandbox restrictions.
            If False, sandbox settings are accepted but not enforced.
        supports_hot_context_within_step: Whether context is preserved across
            Work -> Finalize -> Route phases within a single step. If True, the
            finalize phase can reference work done in the work phase without
            explicit context passing - the conversation state is shared. If False,
            each phase is stateless; summaries must be injected into prompts.
        supports_context_across_steps: Whether context is preserved across
            different steps (Step N -> Step N+1). If True, Step N+1 automatically
            has access to Step N's conversation context. If False, context must be
            rehydrated from artifacts on disk (session amnesia). Note: Flow Studio
            operates with session amnesia - each step starts fresh and rehydrates
            from disk artifacts. This is intentional for auditability.
        supports_streaming: Whether transport supports event streaming.
            If True, events can be consumed as they arrive.
        supports_rewind: Whether transport supports rewinding to checkpoints.
            Reserved for future use.
        max_context_tokens: Maximum context window size (0 = unlimited/unknown).
        provider_name: Human-readable provider name for logging/receipts.

        supports_native_tools: Whether transport has Claude-style native tool calls.
            If True, the transport can invoke tools directly via the model's
            native tool-calling mechanism (function calls, tool_use blocks).
        supports_tool_observation: Whether we can observe tool calls happening.
            If True, tool invocations are visible in the event stream (e.g.,
            JSONL events for Gemini CLI, tool_use events for Claude SDK).
        supports_tool_interception: Whether we can block/modify tool calls.
            If True, pre-tool hooks can prevent or modify tool execution.
            Requires supports_hooks=True for hook registration.
        supports_project_context: Whether transport loads project context files.
            If True, transport automatically loads CLAUDE.md, settings.json,
            and similar project configuration into the model's context.
        structured_output_fallback: Strategy when output_format is unavailable.
            - "none": Transport has native structured output; no fallback needed.
            - "microloop": Use iterative prompting to extract structured output.
            - "best-effort": Parse JSON from markdown fences (may fail).

    This maps to the Claude SDK's `enable_file_checkpointing` and `rewind_files()`
    capabilities. Currently NOT SUPPORTED in Flow Studio for these reasons:

    1. Session Amnesia Model: Flow Studio rehydrates context from disk artifacts
       at each step boundary, making SDK-level checkpointing redundant.

    2. Auditability: Disk-based receipts provide a complete audit trail that
       is independent of SDK state.

    3. Resumability: The existing checkpoint semantics (receipts + artifacts)
       enable resumption from any completed step.

    If SDK checkpointing is needed in the future, this would require:
    - Passing enable_file_checkpointing=True to ClaudeAgentOptions
    - Capturing user_message_uuid from SDK events
    - Calling sdk.rewind_files(uuid) to restore file state
