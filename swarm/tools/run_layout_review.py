run_layout_review.py - UI Review Capture Tool for Flow Studio

This tool captures DOM snapshots, SDK state, and screenshots for each
registered screen in Flow Studio. The artifacts are written to
swarm/runs/ui-review/<timestamp>/ for Claude/MCP consumption.

Usage:
    # Ensure Flow Studio is running first:
    make flow-studio

    # Then run the review:
    uv run swarm/tools/run_layout_review.py

    # Or with custom base URL:
    FLOW_STUDIO_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 uv run swarm/tools/run_layout_review.py

    # Use ux_manifest.json scenes as fallback (when API unavailable):
    uv run swarm/tools/run_layout_review.py --use-manifest

Output structure:
    swarm/runs/ui-review/<timestamp>/
        flows.default/
            dom.html          # HTML snapshot
            state.json        # SDK state (getState() + getGraphState())
            screenshot.png    # Visual capture (if Playwright available)
        flows.selftest/
            ...
        summary.json          # Run summary with all screens and errors

Dependencies:
    - httpx (required)
    - playwright (optional, for screenshots and SDK state extraction)
