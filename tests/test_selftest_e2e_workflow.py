"""
End-to-end selftest workflow tests.

Tests the complete selftest workflow from execution to UI display.
Simulates real user workflow with Flow Studio.

## Test Coverage (10 tests)

1. test_selftest_plan_endpoint_available - /api/selftest/plan is accessible
2. test_plan_data_complete - Plan includes all required fields
3. test_governance_status_structure - Governance status has expected format
4. test_failed_steps_generate_hints - Failed steps produce resolution hints
5. test_degraded_steps_advisory_hints - Degraded steps produce advisory hints
6. test_hint_commands_runnable - Hint commands are valid shell commands
7. test_docs_links_valid_format - Documentation links have valid format
8. test_no_failures_no_hints - No hints when no failures
9. test_all_tiers_represented - All tier types (kernel/governance/optional) present
10. test_summary_counts_accurate - Summary counts match actual step counts
