Task 3: Selftest Modal UI Integration Test (Bonus)

This test suite validates that the selftest modal in Flow Studio integrates
correctly with the backend API and handles edge cases gracefully.

**Integration Points**:
- Modal fetches plan from /api/selftest/plan
- Modal renders step list without crashes
- Modal gracefully handles missing clipboard API
- Modal copyAndRun() command is safe and doesn't crash

**Purpose**: Verify the UI can safely consume the API without crashes and
provides helpful fallback behavior when features are unavailable.

**Test Coverage** (3 tests):
1. test_selftest_modal_can_load_plan - Plan loads without null/undefined
2. test_selftest_modal_graceful_degradation_no_clipboard - Handles missing clipboard
3. test_selftest_modal_copy_and_run_safe - copyAndRun doesn't crash on error
